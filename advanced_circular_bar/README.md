# Guide for using the circular bar script

Thanks for checking out this guide!
In this file are described some cases of how to use the circular bar, but for any doubt or question, don't hesitate to contact me on Discord: **maximilian.volt**!


### Create a circular bar

To create a simple circular bar you can do the following:```gml
// This will create a circular bar with coordinates P(500; 500), a radius of 100 pixels and a width of 20 pixels.
bar = circular_bar_create(500, 500, 100, 20);```

Or this:```gml
bar = circular_bar_create_amplitude(500, 500, 100, 20);```
