# Maximilian Volt's GMS2 scripts

Thanks for checking out my work!
While I learn new things in Computer Science class I also apply my knowledge and skills into gamedev!
I'm currently really busy and won't update things constantly, however if you do find any issues or simply have any questions about my scripts feel free to contact me ***@maximilian.volt*** on Discord.

## Terms of use

**The following is permitted:**

- Importing the script into personal or commercial projects.
- Modifying the script to suit the needs of the project.
- Distributing the source code online **exclusively as an integral part of a game or project that actively uses it**.
- Analyzing and studying how the script works in order to understand its logic, structures, and architectural approaches, as well as developing a script with similar functionality, provided that:

  - the new code is **entirely rewritten from scratch**;
  - no portions of code, textual structures, comments, or internal organization traceable to the original script are copied, in whole or in part;
  - no part of the original code is distributed, even in modified form.

  Functional or conceptual similarity does not constitute a violation, provided that the implementation results from independent development and does not derive from direct copying or adaptation of the original source code.

**The original author must always be credited.** In particular:

- Credit must be clearly visible within the project (e.g., credits section, documentation, repository, or attached license file).
- The author's name may not be removed, replaced, or altered.
- Attribution to the original author remains mandatory even in the case of substantial modifications to the script.

**The following is not permitted:**

- Redistributing the script as a standalone asset, resource, package, or library, whether free or paid.
- Re-uploading or publishing the script (in whole or in part) without attribution to the original author.
- Modifying, falsifying, or removing credit or authorship information contained in the script or its associated documentation.

This license grants a right of use, not a transfer of ownership. All rights not expressly granted remain reserved to the author.
