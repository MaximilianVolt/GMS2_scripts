# Maximilian Volt's GMS2 scripts

Thanks for checking out my work!
While I learn new things in Computer Science class I also apply my knowledge and skills into gamedev!
I'm currently really busy and won't update things constantly, however if you do find any issues or simply have any questions about my scripts feel free to contact me on Discord: *maximilian.volt*.

## Queue

- Rounded polygon
- Bar and animation tool functions
